# Administration

Each folder under administration is a sample that demonstrates using the iTwin Platform API to administer projects, assets, etc.

## Get-ProejctMembers

The *Get-ProjectMembers* script is used by other scripts to show pre- and post- project membership.  

This script can also be used by itself to display project membership.  When doing so, the script requires a project id and an authorization token to be passed in.
